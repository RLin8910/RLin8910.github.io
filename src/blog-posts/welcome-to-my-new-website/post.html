<p>Remember the old, ugly WIX website?

I've got rid of it and replaced it with this!

I learned some basic webdev in a class I took over a year ago, including Node.js and ReactJS, but haven't had the time to apply it anywhere. I've been meaning to remake my own website for a <i>loooong</i> time now - the WIX site was okay to show some general things like a list of my projects, but I hated how unprofessional the WIX banner looked and didn't like how restrictive their website builder was. However, between classes, work, gamedev, and everything else life was throwing at me, I didn't really have time to do anything about it.

That's why I decided to make this website <i>in the middle of finals week instead of studing</i>. Okay, I honestly have no idea what gave me the motivation at this particular time to work on this website. Really, I just wanted to procrastinate on studying, and I procrastinated so hard that I started working on another project I was procrastinating on instead. Maybe that sounds like a bad idea, and yet I did well on my finals anyways - which means that my cycle of procrastination will only get worse since there's no bad consequences to give me a wake-up call. Someday I'll learn...</p>
