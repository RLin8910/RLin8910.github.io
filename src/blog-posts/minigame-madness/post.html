Playable <a href="/minigames">minigames</a> are here!

Although I mostly focus on larger projects like <a href="/the-street-king">The Street King</a> and <a href="/left-turn-legend">Left Turn Legend</a>, I've also done a few smaller games for game jams and other events. I've published 5 of these games to this website! You can find them over on the <a href="/minigames">minigames</a> page. I've also released two <a href="https://youtube.com/c/RaymondLin">YouTube</a> videos describing these games.

These projects are much less polished than my larger games, but they were still very fun to create. Creating an entire game with strict time constraints means that while I am limited in what I'm able to do, I have to get creative in how I spend my time and resources. As a result, these games typically each have a single major mechanic which drives all gameplay.

It's also nice to take a step back from my larger projects from time to time - when I work too long on one thing, I sometimes get a bit of "tunnel vision" which restricts my creativity. Taking a break from those projects and making something fun and sometimes even intentionally bad really helps put things back into perspective and allows me to come back to my larger games with a fresh state of mind.

Check out the games now, or watch my videos going over them:</p>
