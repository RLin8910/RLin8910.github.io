<p><i>
tl;dr I spent 8 years going from knowing nothing about gamedev to releasing an open-world racing game for Android and iOS. Was it financially successful? No. Was it worth it? <b>Absolutely</b>.

I've also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-dyYF10Hqg">posted a video about my story</a> which is more geared towards a casual audience - this post, however, is oriented towards gamedevs.
</i></p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
When I was 13 years old, I downloaded Unity with zero knowledge of game development or programming. Within a year of doing so, I decided to do <i>what every experienced game developer recommends against</i>: I set out to create a massive open world game with online multiplayer as my first project.

I'm now 22 with a full-time job and a college degree. I released my magnum opus, The Street King, 5 years ago, but I've continued to update it ever since. <a href="https://raymond-lin.com/the-street-king">The Street King</a> is an open-world street racing game featuring almost 50 playable cars, visual and performance customizations, police chases, and online multiplayer. I created almost all of the assets for the game, including 3D models of the cars and environments, textures, scripts, and even the game's theme song. With it being the 5-year anniversary of the game's release, now is a good time for me to tell my story and reflect.
</p>

<h3>How Did I Make the Game?</h3>
<p>
When I first started, I just copy-pasted code from the internet, but slowly learned over time. My dad had taught me 3D modeling prior to my gamedev endeavors, so I have and still do use exclusively my own models - I make all of my own models and don't download them from asset packs. I'd always had an affinity for math and learning, and I ended up majoring in Computer Science in college, so finding this to be such a strong interest definitely helped me maintain motivation.

I ignored all of the advice online saying to start small and decided that my first project would be an open-world racing game. To be honest, my lack of knowledge worked in my favor - if I had known just how much work it would have entailed, I might not have followed through, but I was able to slowly but surely make progress over the course of several years until I released the game as what was initially an Android exclusive on August 20, 2018.

It definitely also helped that I began this game as a kid - the amount of free time I had compared to a working adult made it much easier to find the motivation and energy to continue. That being said, I still definitely recommend that new developers not do what I did and start small instead - this was a very fun project for myself personally, but it isn't for everyone.

I continued updating the game for the next few years, throughout college and all the way to the present day. Throughout that time, I:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expanded the car list from only 16 on release to 46 currently </li>
    <li>Added new regions to the world map</li>
    <li>Implemented peer-to-peer online multiplayer with support for up to 5 concurrent players racing each other per session</li>
    <li>Released a second game set in the same universe called <a href="https://raymond-lin.com/left-turn-legend">Left Turn Legend</a>, although that isn't the subject of this post</li>
    <li>Ported The Street King to iOS as well, with cross-platform multiplayer with Android players</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Challenges Did I Face?</h3>
<p>
The obvious challenge here is the sheer amount of work involved. Creating nearly all of the assets myself was a huge task. What made this possible even as a kid was good time management and to some extent a level of motivation that I honestly don't understand how I used to have.

Another big issue was the amount that I and the gaming landscape changed over time. Making a project that lasts this long means that the standards gamers had when I began are not the same as they are when I end. This is especially clear graphically - car models which I made earlier in the game's development are much lower in polygon count and rougher looking due both to this and the fact that I was improving my modeling skills over time. On the bright side, one good thing to come out of this is more powerful phones/tablets being released which I could leverage. Races in the original release were limited to less than 10 concurrent cars when including all player, opponent, and police cars, but in a recent update, I was able to implement 40-car drafting-style stock car racing to take advantage of how much more powerful mobile devices had become.

<h3>How Did the Game Perform Post-Release?</h3>
<p>
The biggest challenge, however, has come these past 5 years after release. By objective standards of download count and revenue, this game is technically a failure.

The Street King has had over 200k installs on Android and only 6k on iOS, although the iOS release was only about a year and a half ago. It brings in enough income to at least offset the cost of services like multiplayer servers and Apple's yearly developer fee, but it does not turn a profit (which is why I still need a full-time job). I've boiled this down to several reasons:
</p>

<h3>Lack of Marketing</h3>
<p>This is partially on myself but also largely just something that I believe is inescapable as a solo developer: <b>marketing is hard</b>. Although I definitely could have put more effort into marketing the game, a lot of it also just came down to lack of funding - it wasn't feasible to buy ad spaces because of the next point...</p>

<h3>Need for More Aggressive Monetization</h3>
<p>
The Street King uses ads and in-app purchases for monetization, but I think I was held back a lot by "feeling bad" for making a game that's pay to win. As a result, the economy is balanced such that it is completely feasible to beat in a reasonable number of hours without spending a single cent. Unfortunately for me, that's exactly what the vast majority of my players do, and those that do spend some money don't have much incentive to spend more because making a few in-app purchases is already enough.

The positive side of this is that the small community that I have built are very thankful for the game's economy balancing, which is certainly a good thing.
</p>

<h3>AAA Competitors</h3>
<p>I tried to provide what was at least gameplay-wise a unique experience. Compared to other similar mobile street racing titles like Need for Speed No Limits, my hope was that The Street King would provide an experience that was far less watered-down. The game is oriented towards a more hardcore audience than most mobile racing games which employ simple one-touch controls that give very little control over the actual driving. In The Street King, the player is free to drive wherever they want in the world and dynamically start cop chases or races. Regardless of my goals, there is an obvious difference in graphics and marketing, which is what prospective players are going to see first before they download the game. They'll never be able to experience the gameplay and decide if they like it in the first place if they choose not to install the game based on its graphics. This is something that I unfortunately don't really have an answer to - especially since I make all of the models myself, the game's graphics are largely constrained by the amount of work I'm able to do rather than technical hardware limitations.</p>

<h3>The Positives</h3>
<p>
A lot of the above might seem pretty negative, but that's only because I wanted to look at the game in an objective, "was it a commercial success?" sort of light. Creating a financially-successful game would certainly be nice, but it wasn't my goal from the beginning - I set out to make something that I would want to play and could have fun developing, and from that viewpoint, it was absolutely a success. To drive this point further, I'd like to mention that at one point prior to release, I'd even considered releasing the game as 100% free with no monetization whatsoever.

It also may or may not have given me something else very important. My dream college was very competitive, and although I don't have any evidence either way, submitting a profile about The Street King may have been what allowed me to make the cut.

I've built up a small but dedicated community over the years who shares my love of cars and video games, and working on this game has been an absolute blast. At the end of the day, The Street King only exists because I really wanted to make my dream game, no matter what it took - and in the end, it looks like it all worked out.
