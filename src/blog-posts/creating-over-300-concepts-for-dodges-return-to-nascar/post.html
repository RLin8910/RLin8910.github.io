<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>NASCAR is the most popular form of motorsport in the United States, and a variety of car manufacturers have joined and left the sport throughout the past century. Despite Dodge’s long history of success and fan-favorite status, the brand left the sport after winning the 2012 Cup Championship and has yet to return.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to construct a “what-if” concept for Dodge’s return to the NASCAR Cup Series in the 2022 season using their Charger sedan. NASCAR cars are designed to look similar to their production counterparts, but are heavily constrained in their dimensions while being aerodynamically optimized for racing. This project creates a parametrized design space for a NASCAR Dodge Charger concept with different body shapes within the constraints and seeks to find the Pareto-optimal designs in that space which minimize two aerodynamic properties: drag and lift. Negative lift is also referred to as downforce and is desirable to increase vehicle stability at high speed. Determination of aerodynamic properties is accomplished using OpenFOAM, a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation program.</p>
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>Aerodynamics are extremely important to the driving dynamics of race cars and have been studied extensively in NASCAR. Real-world testing data is gathered by race teams for the most accurate results, but the development of CFD technology has made simulations a cheaper and faster alternative to iterate design changes with. Although research by the car manufacturers themselves is proprietary, a number of independent parties have conducted CFD research as well. This paper describes the results of CFD simulation on a Gen 6 Cup Series Car using various simulation models. Due to safety concerns, NASCAR cars typically do not exceed speeds of 95 m/s, so these simulations are all able to achieve accurate results using incompressible air models.</p>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>There are four major components to this project: </p>
<p><ol><li>Creating a base concept design for the NASCAR Dodge Charger:
<ul><li>The model was created from scratch using Blender. Reference photos and blueprints of the NASCAR Chevrolet Camaro as well as the production Dodge Charger were used in tandem to create a concept NASCAR Dodge Charger which looks like the production car but fits NASCAR’s vehicle shape constraints.
</li></ul>

<li>Parameterizing deformations on the design to allow it to become an entire design space:<ul>
<li>Using Blender’s bpy Python API and deformation cages, the front end of the car model can be parametrically deformed, with the result exported to an .obj file. Two parameters exist: one which deforms the nose vertically and another which deforms the nose forwards and backwards. Both parameters are in the range [-1, 1]. Other parts of the car cannot be deformed due to NASCAR’s vehicle shape constraints, which conveniently reduces the number of dimensions needed for parameterization.</li></ul>
<p><img src="/media/blog/creating-over-300-concepts-for-dodges-return-to-nascar/nose_shapes.jpg"></img></p></li>
<li>Simulating aerodynamic properties of individual designs:
<ul><li>Once an individual design has been exported as an .obj, aerodynamic simulation is run. All designs use the same simulation parameters: incompressible airflow of 30 m/s backwards relative to the vehicle on flat, level ground, for 500 timesteps with a timestep size of 1 second. To reduce noise in the data, the drag and downforce for a design are calculated by averaging their values across the final 50 timesteps.</li></ul>

<li>Using Bayesian Optimization to find parameters which generate designs with Pareto-optimal aerodynamic properties:
<ul><li>The high time cost of simulating a single design combined with a likely nonconvex optimization function with two parameters and two objectives made multi-objective Bayesian Optimization an obvious choice for parameter selection. This was implemented using BoTorch in Python to choose parameters for the next simulation. The next design would then be programmatically generated using step 2) and the simulation would run with step 3).</li></ul></li>
</ol></p>
<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>Once the above steps were implemented, the simulations could run without any manual input. The process would automatically query previous data and use Bayesian Optimization to determine the next set of parameters to use. Then, it would generate the corresponding design and simulate its aerodynamic properties. After writing the results to an output file, the process would repeat.</p>
<p>301 different designs in the design space were simulated over a total runtime of about 176 hours.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Of the 12 Pareto-optimal designs, the majority had a negative value for their second parameter, which corresponds to lowering the nose of the car. Intuitively, this makes sense, as raising the nose would increase drag via increased surface area and increase lift through a suboptimal shape. However, there was much less of a clear correlation between the first parameter and the resulting model’s aerodynamics. That being said, there is clearly a tradeoff between drag and downforce, which illustrates how the design can be optimized for different targets depending on which is more important. </p>

<p>Comparison to real-world data shows why manufacturers still prefer wind tunnel testing for more accurate results. While drag values were roughly accurate, the simulations produced significantly less downforce than expected. Some of this can be attributed to the fact that the spinning of the tires was not simulated – this has been shown to decrease both drag and lift, meaning that wheel rotation improves aerodynamic performance. Another possible source of error comes from noise in the aerodynamic data. While attempts were made to mitigate this by taking the average over many samples, this likely could have been made more effective if the number of timesteps per simulation were increased to allow for better convergence of results. However, this was infeasible to accomplish within this project’s time constraints due to the sheer amount of time it took a single aerodynamic simulation to complete – on average, each individual design took over half an hour to simulate.</p>

<p>Overall, this project gives a demonstration of some of the optimization techniques which manufacturers may use when designing car bodies for NASCAR and other racing series. The Pareto-optimal designs give glimpses into possible body styles which Dodge could use if they were to reenter NASCAR.</p>
