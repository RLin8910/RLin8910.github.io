<p>On December 5, 2024, I made a huge decision. I pulled the trigger on purchasing my dream car: a 2016 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Z51 with the 7-speed manual transmission. I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dDTEYjx_qI">YouTube video giving my initial thoughts on the car</a> a few months ago, and I'd like to come back now after owning the car for a little over a full year. This car has served as both my sole daily driver and weekend fun car, including spirited drives, autocross, and even a track day at Thunderhill Raceway, so I've experienced the Corvette in pretty much every sort of driving it was made for now.</p>

<p>I've split this into 4 major parts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Daily Driving</li>
    <li>Spirited Driving</li>
    <li>Performance Driving</li>
    <li>Conclusion</li>

<h3>Daily Driving</h3>
<p>Let's get started with the obvious - there's a lot of practicality issues that come with daily-driving a C7 Corvette. Having only 2 seats means resorting to renting a car whenever more than one friend visits me in California. Fuel economy is around 15 mpg in daily use and drops into the single digits with a heavy right foot. Visibility in any direction that isn't straight forward is abysmal, and I've found that the safest way to change lanes is to speed up so that even if someone's in my blindspot, I'll just overtake them anyways.</p>

<p>Despite all this, though, there are many ways in which the car managed to surprise me in its practicality. The suspension is very comfortable during cruising thanks to the car's adjustable suspension dampers, allowing it to absorb bumps on the street or stiffen up for performance on the track depending on the mode you select. The trunk is huge - at 15 cubic feet in volume, it actually beats out my previous car, the 2022 Honda Civic Si, which is "only" 14.8 cubic feet. That being said, the height of the trunk opening and the fact that rear access is blocked further by the spoiler makes it a pain to load heavy objects in.</p>

<p>Reliability has also been solid so far. After 12k miles and 3 oil changes, the car hasn't given me any real problems, save for one time when the intake hose suddenly disconnected and triggered a vacuum leak. Fortunately, the fix was super simple - just shove the hose back in and tighten the clamp again - although I do have to wonder why GM didn't design something more robust with actual screws to hold the hose in place.</p>

<p><i>Glad it was nothing major, but this gave me a mini heart attack!</i></p>

<p>Serviceability isn't the best or the worst. I haven't done anything major on the car besides regular maintenance items like oil changes and a couple more track-oriented things like preemptively flushing my brake fluid. Things are generally straightforward, but the location of some things leaves me scratching my head. Why is the second drain plug for the dry sump oil system in such a bad spot???</p>

<h3>Spirited Driving</h3>
<p>Now for the fun part: how does the Corvette do in fun driving?</p>

<p>On windy mountain roads, the Corvette is fast, sounds great, and a blast to drive with the top off. It's almost too fast, though - the torquey engine and tall gearing mean that you don't actually get much opportunity to shift the 7-speed manual transmission, and it's very easy to find yourself going faster than you reasonably should be.</p>

<p><i>Completely unnecessary downshift into 1st gear, lol.</i></p>

<p>The steering feel is decent but not great for a modern car. It still gives less feedback than older hydraulic systems or a few modern exceptions, and I'd prefer a bit more.</p>

<p>It's a weird thing to complain about, but the car feels <i>too</i> composed. During spirited driving on the streets, where you won't want to be pushing to 10/10ths, there isn't quite enough drama to be found. Although the 'Vette is much faster in reality, it doesn't <i>feel</i> as fast as much slower cars like Miatas, where the bodyroll and feedback make things feel much more exciting even if you're well under the absolute limits of the car. All that is to say that despite the fun you can have, you're always very aware of just how far below the car's capabilities you have to drive to be safe on the streets. There's a reason people like driving slow cars fast - the perception of speed is arguably more important than how fast you're actually going.</p>

<h3>Performance Driving</h3>
<p>Pushing the Corvette all the way to the limits is a completely different story. I started with autocross to learn car control and quickly learned that with traction and stability control off, the car is nothing short of a handful. The experience is dominated by the constant threat of spinning out from too much gas. It's an exercise in throttle control that has me imagining an egg underneath the pedal.</p>

<p><i>Left: Almost spinning out. Right: a class-winning run!</i></p>

<p>As I got more familiar with the car, I started to become more aware of its strengths and weaknesses. The monstrous 460 horsepower obviously gave me an advantage on the straights, but autocross rarely gives you the space to let it stretch its legs. Handling is generally neutral and the car has plenty of grip, but I did start to find that the Corvette understeers on corner entry even with proper trail braking. I'm able to get plenty of rotation on-throttle, but off-throttle it often gets tight.</p>

<p>Where the Corvette really shines is at the racetrack. The longer straights allow the powerful V8 to to rocket the car away, and its weight is less of a hinderance since tracks tend to have longer, sustained corners rather than the nimble back-and-forth slaloms featured in autocross. I've only done one trackday so far at Thunderhill Raceway's 3-mile East configuration, but I already know that I'll be doing a lot more in 2026.</p>

<p><i>My best lap at Thunderhill East.</i></p>

<p>The Z51 package really pulls its weight on the track. The dry sump oil system and enhanced brake cooling meant that the car had no problems taking everything that I threw at it. I was surprised at just how little the brakes degraded over the three 20-minute long sessions despite the fact that I was slamming on them to make every corner. As a first-timer on 300tw street tires, I was able to run a 2:09 but could tell that the car still had a lot left to give even without any upgrades.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>They say to never meet your heros, but in this case, I have to say that I'm quite glad that I did. It isn't perfect, but the Corvette is a great all-around car that's surprisingly capable not just in performance driving but even in mundane everyday commutes. There's certainly things I could complain about and wish to be improved, but overall, I can gladly say that I don't have any regrets with the car.</p>
