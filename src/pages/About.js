                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Raymond, and I'm a solo game developer. I've been super interested in games and
                        computers from a young age, so picking up game dev was a natural next step!
                        {'\r\n\r\n'}
                        I've now been making games for almost 10 years. Although many of my first projects were
                        never published and have now been lost to time, I have two major published games:{' '}
                        <a href="/the-street-king">The Street King</a> and <a href="/left-turn-legend">Left Turn Legend</a>. 
                        Both of these games are expressions of my passion for cars as they explore the worlds of illegal street
                        racing and sanctioned oval circuit racing in the USA, respectively.
                        {'\r\n\r\n'}I also created several{' '}
                        <a href="/minigames">smaller games</a> which can be found and played in-browser right here on this site.
                        {'\r\n\r\n'}
                        Besides games and cars, I also enjoy both listening to music and performing it as a violinist.
                        I am currently working full-time as a software developer but hope to one day start my own video game 
                        studio.
